Any company owner can deploy the payroll contract which will use a unique token as payment.
Company owner can do all CRUD operations of an employee and also gives the employee the ability to claim his salary.
In addition any employee can stake his salary for extra income. In case employee stakes for a specific period he company will mint him extra 10% bonus on his inital stake.
